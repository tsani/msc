                   proof documents, called Intelligible semi-automated
                   reasoning (Isar). It addresses the major problem of
                   existing interactive theorem proving systems that
                   there is no appropriate notion of proof available
                   that is suitable for human communication, or even
                   just maintenance. Isar's main aspect is its formal
                   language for natural deduction proofs, which sets out
                   to bridge the semantic gap between internal notions
                   of proof given by state-of-the-art interactive
                   theorem proving systems and an appropriate level of
                   abstraction for user-level work. The Isar language is
                   both human readable and machine-checkable, by virtue
                   of the Isar/VM interpreter.},

 abstract = {A methodology for computer assisted proof is presented with an example. A central ingredient in the methods is the presentation of tactics (or strategies) in an algorithmic metalanguage. Further, the same language is also used to express combinators, by which simple elementary tactics -- which often correspond to the inference rules of the logic employed -- are combined into more complex tactics, which may even be strategies complete for a class of problems. However, the emphasis is not upon completeness but upon providing a metalogical framework within which a user may express his insight into proof methods and may delegate routine (but error-prone) work to the computer. This method of tactic composition is presented at the start of the paper in the form of an elementary theory of goal-seeking. A second ingredient of the methodology is the stratification of machine-assisted proof by an ancestry graph of applied theories, and the example illustrates this stratification. In the final section, some recent developments and applications of the method are cited.},

	abstract = {The deep symmetry of Linear Logic 18] makes it suitable for providing abstract models of computation, free from implementation details which are, by nature, oriented and non symmetrical. I propose here one such model, in the area of Logic Programming, where the basic computational principle is Computation = Proof search. Proofs considered here are those of the Gentzen style sequent calculus for Linear Logic. However, proofs in this system may be redundant, in that two proofs can be syntactically di erent although identical up to some irrelevant reordering or simpli cation of the applications of the inference rules. This leads to an untractable proof search where the search procedure is forced to make costly choices which turn out to be irrelevant. To overcome this problem, a subclass of proofs, called the {\textbackslash}focusing" proofs, which is both complete (any derivable formula in Linear Logic has a focusing proof) and tractable (many irrelevant choices in the search are eliminated when aimed at focusing proofs) is identi ed. The main constraint underlying the speci cation of focusing proofs has been to preserve the symmetry of Linear Logic, which is its most salient feature. In particular, dual connectives have dual properties with respect to focusing proofs.},

	abstract = {Template-Coq5 is a plugin for Coq, originally implemented by Malecha [17], which provides a reiﬁer for Coq terms and global declarations, as represented in the Coq kernel, as well as a denotation command. Initially, it was developed for the purpose of writing functions on Coq’s AST in Gallina. Recently, it was used in the CertiCoq certiﬁed compiler project [4], as its front-end language, to derive parametricity properties [3], and to extract Coq terms to a CBV λ-calculus [13]. However, the syntax lacked semantics, be it typing semantics or operational semantics, which should reﬂect, as formal speciﬁcations in Coq, the semantics of Coq’s type theory itself. The tool was also rather bare bones, providing only rudimentary quoting and unquoting commands. We generalize it to handle the entire Calculus of Inductive Constructions (CIC), as implemented by Coq, including the kernel’s declaration structures for deﬁnitions and inductives, and implement a monad for general manipulation of Coq’s logical environment. We demonstrate how this setup allows Coq users to deﬁne many kinds of general purpose plugins, whose correctness can be readily proved in the system itself, and that can be run eﬃciently after extraction. We give a few examples of implemented plugins, including a parametricity translation. We also advocate the use of Template-Coq as a foundation for higher-level tools.},

The price they pay for this ﬂexibility is often the need to build and check explicit proof objects which can be expensive. In this work we develop a collection of techniques for building reﬂective automation, where proofs are witnessed by veriﬁed decision procedures rather than verbose proof objects. Our techniques center around a veriﬁed domain speciﬁc language for proving, Rtac, written in Gallina, Coq’s logic. The design of tactics makes it easy to combine them into higher-level automation that can be proved sound in a mostly automated way. Furthermore, unlike traditional uses of reﬂection, Rtac tactics are independent of the underlying problem domain. This allows them to be re-tasked to automate new problems with very little eﬀort. We demonstrate the usability of Rtac through several case studies demonstrating orders of magnitude speedups for relatively little engineering work.},

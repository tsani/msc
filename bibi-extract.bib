  abstract =      {We present a generic approach to readable formal
                   proof documents, called Intelligible semi-automated
                   reasoning (Isar). It addresses the major problem of
                   existing interactive theorem proving systems that
                   there is no appropriate notion of proof available
                   that is suitable for human communication, or even
                   just maintenance. Isar's main aspect is its formal
                   language for natural deduction proofs, which sets out
                   to bridge the semantic gap between internal notions
                   of proof given by state-of-the-art interactive
                   theorem proving systems and an appropriate level of
                   abstraction for user-level work. The Isar language is
                   both human readable and machine-checkable, by virtue
                   of the Isar/VM interpreter.},

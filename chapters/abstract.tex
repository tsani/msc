Beluga is a proof environment based on the logical framework LF that provides
infrastructural support for representing formal systems and proofs about them.
As a consequence, meta-theoretic proofs are precise and compact. However,
programmers write proofs as total recursive programs. This can be challenging
and cumbersome.

We present the design and implementation of Harpoon, an interactive proof
environment built on top of Beluga. Harpoon users develop proofs using a small,
fixed set of tactics. Behind the scenes, the execution of tactics elaborates a
proof script that reflects the subgoal structure of the proof. We model
incomplete proofs using contextual variables to represent holes.
We give a sound translation of proof scripts into Beluga programs which allows
us to execute them. Proof scripts and programs seamlessly interact and can be
used interchangeably.

We have used Harpoon for examples ranging from simple type safety proofs for
MiniML to normalization proofs including the recently proposed POPLMark reloaded
challenge.
Our implementation is a part of Beluga on GitHub at
\url{https://github.com/Beluga-lang/Beluga} and the reference manual is
available at \url{https://beluga-lang.readthedocs.io/}.

\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

\inlinetodo{%

  about the case studies we developed.
  Perhaps I can roll this into the next chapter, renaming the chapter to
  ``Evaluation \& conclusion''.

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item\label{itm:evaluation-remark1}
%   All solve commands include only two or less terms; with more automation tactic this example may be solved automatically.
% \item\label{itm:evaluation-remark3}
%   This uses a lot of unbox tactic. Providing a way to automate unbox tactic may be helpful.
% \item\label{itm:evaluation-remark5}
%   Auto invert tactic would simplify this example.
